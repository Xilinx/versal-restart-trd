The Versal System and Subsystem Restart TRD (**VSSR TRD**), also referred to as
**Versal Restart TRD**, demonstrates how to restart various components of a system.
It also showcases the liveliness of a subsystem while another subsystem is undergoing
restart.

The TRD consists of a baseline Vivado design, Petalinux, Jupyter notebooks and other
software components to demonstrate different restart scenarios.

This repository provides all the sources of TRD and their build infrastructure.
